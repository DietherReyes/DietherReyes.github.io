      Favorite CMSC Subject : CMSC 141 <br> <br>
      Reason : Even though I struggled a bit on the exams, learning <br>
      how state diagrams worked and their applications made me enjoy the course<br> <br>

      Favorite Food : Sisig <br> <br>
      Reason : I've recently taken a liking to freshly cooked Sisig in the sizzling plate, <br>
      with a cracked egg slowly cooking above it, garnished with a bunch of chicharon..yum!<br> <br>

      About Yourself : 18 year old dude that hasn't secured any government ID yet, what's up? <br> <br>

      Expectations for the Subject/Teacher : Because I had some peers that took the subject recently, <br>
        I hope that I can experience fun lab sessions which are also immersive. I hope that the teacher can achieve <br>
        said expectations for the laboratory sessions and make it a memorable one.<br> <br>
