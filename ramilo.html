		<h3>Favorite CMSC subject</h3>
			<p>My favorite subject is <strong>CMSC 21</strong> because it's the latest CMSC course I took (<em>I took other CMSC courses a bajillion years ago</em>), ergo the only CMSC course with topics which I can still remember to date. Also, I like how we're like solving puzzles during lab meetings/exers.
